"Running Jupyter Lab with Docker" by chameleon

NOTE: 
✔️ If the docker command stops responding, e.g. after deleting the Docker RAW file, should reset to factory default. 

✔️ Also, Docker.raw will be large in size, so specify the storage destination to an external SSD by changing the Disk image location in Extension.

✔️ If you get the error "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?", search for 'Docker' in Activity Monitor and stop it.
